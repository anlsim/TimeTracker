# TimeTracker
 
A class team project was a web application that allows you to organize and keep track of your tasks.
After class ended, I redesigned the View, added new features to optimize the project. 
Tools used: C#, ASP.Net,  bootstrap, MVC Web application running on a Windows server, hosted on Azure.
